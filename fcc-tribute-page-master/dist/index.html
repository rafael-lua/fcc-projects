		<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–91) was an Austrian composer. Mozart composed music in several genres, including opera and symphony and is widely recognized as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>History: </strong>
			<ul id="history" style="font-size: 0.9em;">
				<li>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on 27 January 1756 to Leopold Mozart (1719–1787) and Anna Maria, née Pertl (1720–1778), at Getreidegasse 9 in Salzburg.</li>
				<li><em>(1762–73) </em>While Wolfgang was young, his family made several European journeys in which he and Nannerl performed as child prodigies.</li>
				<li><em>(1773–77) </em>After finally returning with his father from Italy on 13 March 1773, Mozart was employed as a court musician by the ruler of Salzburg, Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo.</li>
				<li><em>(1777–78) </em>In August 1777, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburg and on 23 September ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to Augsburg, Mannheim, Paris, and Munich.</li>
				<li><em>(1782–87) </em>From 1782 to 1785 Mozart mounted concerts with himself as a soloist, presenting three or four new piano concertos in each season.</li>
				<li><em>(1786–87) </em>Around the end of 1785, Mozart moved away from keyboard writing and began his famous operatic collaboration with the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte. 1786 saw the successful premiere of The Marriage of Figaro in Vienna.</li>
				<li><em>(1788–90) </em>Toward the end of the decade, Mozart's circumstances worsened. Around 1786 he had ceased to appear frequently in public concerts, and his income shrank. By mid-1788, Mozart and his family had moved from central Vienna to the suburb of Alsergrund.</li>
				<li><em>(1791) </em>Mozart's last year was, until his final illness struck, a time of high productivity—and by some accounts, one of personal recovery. He composed a great deal, including some of his most admired works: the opera The Magic Flute; the final piano concerto (K. 595 in B♭); the Clarinet Concerto K. 622; the last in his series of string quintets (K. 614 in E♭); the motet Ave verum corpus K. 618; and the unfinished Requiem K. 626.</li>
				<li>Mozart fell ill while in Prague for the premiere, on 6 September 1791, of his opera La clemenza di Tito, which was written in that same year on commission for the Emperor's coronation festivities. Mozart died in his home on 5 December 1791 (aged 35).</li>
